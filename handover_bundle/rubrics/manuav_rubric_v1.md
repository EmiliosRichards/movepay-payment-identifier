## Manuav rubric (v1, condensed; for single-call web-researched scoring)

### Context
Manuav is a B2B cold outbound (phone outreach) + lead-generation agency (“Sales Center, not Call Center”).

Default market lens is **DACH** (Germany / Austria / Switzerland). If DACH evidence is missing, be conservative.

### Output
- **Recommendation**: pursue / investigate / exclude
- **Fit score** (0–10)
  - 0–3: unsuitable / very uncertain
  - 4–6: okay/neutral
  - 7–8: attractive target
  - 9–10: rare ideal customer
- **Weakest-link constraint**: the single most limiting factor and how it caps/pulls down the score
- **Confidence**: low / medium / high

### Scoring logic: gating vs shaping
Treat categories in two groups.

#### 1) Gating (downward-only)
These can **pull the overall score down hard** if weak, but do not “boost” the score when strong.

- **B2B fit clarity**
  - High: clear B2B language, decision-maker personas, explicit ICP
  - Low: mostly B2C, consumer-first, unclear buyer

- **DACH focus / presence**
  - High: DACH locations, German content, DACH customers/cases, explicit DACH targeting
  - Low: no DACH signals; appears focused elsewhere

- **DACH target market size (TAM)**
  - Strong: ≥ ~1,000 relevant companies in DACH
  - Very strong: 5,000+ (or 25,000+ when clearly supported)
  - Weak: clearly < 500 (cap overall score unless extreme ACVs)

- **Economic viability for outbound**
  - Strong: recurring revenue / high ACV / strong LTV; outbound CAC can be justified
  - Weak: tiny one-off tickets, low price SMB self-serve, unclear monetization

- **Onboarding capacity (10+ new customers/month)**
  - Strong: productized SaaS/standardized delivery; can absorb volume
  - Weak: bespoke projects, limited throughput (cap overall score)

- **Risk profile / excluded contexts**
  - Exclude or score very low when clearly applicable:
    - associations/chambers/political orgs with tiny addressable base
    - insolvency/restructuring law (referral-driven, reputational sensitivity)
    - strongly state/procurement-bound orgs
    - micro-services with non-scalable markets
  - Be conservative for high-reputation/regulatory risk categories unless evidence is strong.

#### 2) Shaping (sets upside potential)
These determine the plausible upside (e.g., whether 7–8 or 9–10 is justified) and can also pull down if weak.

- **Innovation / “why now?”**
  - Positive: SaaS/tech, automation/AI, measurable efficiency/revenue impact

- **Differentiation / Red-ocean risk**
  - Positive: clear niche/USP; not a commodity category
  - Negative: highly interchangeable “red ocean” with heavy price pressure

- **Phone pitch potential**
  - Positive: 1–2 sentence pitch, clear pain + ROI, logical CTA, reachable buyer personas
  - Negative: conservative/referral-driven personas; high interruption aversion

### Hard downward triggers (apply when clearly supported)
- Mostly B2C / unclear B2B → overall score typically 0–2.
- Excluded/highly problematic contexts (above) → overall score typically 0–3.
- Clear inability to onboard anywhere near 10+/month (bespoke) → cap overall score (often ≤ 5, sometimes ≤ 3).
- Clear DACH TAM < 500 (and not extreme ACV) → cap overall score ≤ 3.

### Evidence discipline
- Prefer primary sources (company website, pricing, careers, cases) and reputable third-party sources.
- If critical info is missing (ICP, DACH presence, pricing/ACV), lower confidence and be conservative.
